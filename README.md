# Migration route of Swiss Ring Ouzel

This GeoLocator Datapackage contains the raw data for 5 multi-sensor geolocators and 4 light-level geolocators data equipped on Alpine Ring Ouzels (Turdus torquatus alpestris) in Switzerland between 2017-2020. The data has been processed using the GeoPressureR package to produce trajectories for the 5 multi-sensor tags. Code can be found on Github [Rafnuss/migration-route-of-swiss-ring-ouzels](https://github.com/Rafnuss/migration-route-of-swiss-ring-ouzels). The raw data has been used in [10.1111/jav.02860](https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.02860)
